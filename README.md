# Stock Price Prediction with Keras and scikit-learn

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict stock prices based on historical data. It utilizes the Keras library for building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- Python (3.x)
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - Keras

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your data:

   - Ensure your dataset contains at least the following columns: 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume'.
   - Replace `'your_data.csv'` in the script with the actual file or data source.

4. Run the script:


   python stock_prediction.py
  

## Customization

- Adjust hyperparameters, sequence length, and model architecture in `stock_prediction.py` to suit your specific requirements.
- Experiment with additional features and technical indicators for improved predictions.

## Results

- The model will be trained and evaluated on the provided dataset.
- The Mean Squared Error (MSE) will be displayed as an evaluation metric.

## Disclaimer

- Stock price prediction involves inherent risks. Predictions are based on historical data and patterns, and the actual market behavior may vary.
- Use the predictions cautiously and consider consulting with financial experts.
